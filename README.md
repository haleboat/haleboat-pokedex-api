This is a project built around the open-source [Pokedex-API](https://pokeapi.co/).

Entirely front-end, built with HTML/CSS/JS.

# Introduction
I am a student in the Web Development program at SAIT in Calgary, AB.

This was initially an assignment that I've been working on after the fact. The reason why, is to further enhance my knowledge and try new things.

The javascript is commented and documented throughout so feel free to take a look. It still needs alot of clean up and is something I'm actively working on.

### Updates from the original assignment
- Updating theme
- Search feature
- Adding evolution chain to the view card
- Making mobile friendly/responsive

### Some ideas I've had so far are:
- Add more funcionality to the website through filter options
- Have cards display more information on the pokemon
- Update the theme away from the green-scale 'gameboy' feel
- Convert CSS to Sass
- Add more accessibility
- Make site more responsive
- Component based/structured javascript
- Implement async/await functions

### Some ideas that I pursued and didn't follow through:
- Build with nodeJS
  - ejs/pug
    - I didn't follow through because of the submission due date and I'm still researching modules that would be a better fit considering these engines are great for multi-page websites.
  - mongoDB
    - Populating a mongoDB collection with the API data as there is alot of fluff in the API that I initially didn't care about.
    - Rebuilding an already accesible 'collection' of sorts through the already provided API is kind of like re-inventing the wheel and redundant.
- Build with React
  - Though I havn't dipped my toes into React yet, it is something I'd really like to learn.
- Build with Vue
  - Again, same with React.
