# Introduction
I am a student in the Web Development program at SAIT in Calgary, AB.

This was initially an assignment that I've been working on after the fact. The reason why is to further enhance my knowledge and try new things.

Some ideas I've had so far are:
- Add more funcionality to the website through filter options.
- Have cards display more information on the program.
- Update the theme away from the green-scale 'gameboy' feel.
- Convert CSS to Sass.
- Add more accessibility.
- Make site more responsive.

Some ideas that I pursued and didn't follow through:
- Build with nodeJS
  - ejs/pug
    - I didn't follow through because of the submission due date and I'm still researching modules that would be a better fit considering these engines are great for multi-page websites.
  - mongoDB
    - Populating a mongoDB collection with the data from API as there is alot of fluff in the API that I initially didn't care about.
    - Rebuilding an already accesible 'collection' of sorts through the already provided API is kind of like re-inventing the wheel and redundant.
